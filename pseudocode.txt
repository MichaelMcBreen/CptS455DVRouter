    - call DVsimulator for each router

DVsimulator [-p option] testdirname routername
    - create output file (ex: routername.output)                    - QUANG
    - call readrouters to grab address and port to setup sockets    - QUANG
		-save the socket in a dictionary with the (baseport + offset(fd))
		-key by fd and tupple {socket, routername}

    - call readlink based on the routername                         - QUANG
       (ex: DVtable = readlinks(testdirname, routername) )
        - grab DVtable info stored as a dictionary                  - QUANG
    
    - select returns a list of available ports                      - BEN
        - get list of ports we can receive from and send to
        - finds if there is data to read from ports and reads
        - for each port that we read from, call updaterouterDVtable()
            - DVtable algorithm updates routername DVtable          - Michael

        - send update DVtable to all neighbors
